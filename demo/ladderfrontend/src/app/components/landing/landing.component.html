    <h2>About the Tennis Ladder</h2>
    <p>
      Our tennis ladder is a dynamic ranking system that allows players to challenge each other and move up or down based on match results. 
      Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Register: Provide your contact information, times your available to play, your prefered court, and your skill level to join the ladder</li>
      <li>Challenge players to play matches at least once a week.</li>
      <li>Report match scores after winning a match</li>
      <li>View current standings and player profiles</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Ladder matches will be played based on the USTA 3 set format, where the 3rd set is played as a 10 point tiebreaker. Matches outdoors are played with no time limit.  Indoor matches will be limited to 2 hours.  If a match is interrupted due to darkness or rain the 2 players will agree upon a time to complete the match and it will be completed within a week.</li>
      <li>Both players will be required to bring a can of balls to the match.</li>
      <li>Players will be required to show up at least 10 minutes early for the match.</li>
      <li>The winner of the match keeps the can of unused balls and reports the scores.</li>
      <li>There will be a $20 charge to play in the Ladder and I will collect it when I play each person in the ladder</li>
    </ul>
